      <h3>About Spotter</h3>
      <p className='question'>Ever founding yourself wanting to get fit but lacking the motivation?</p>
      <p className='question'>Ever looked for friends to help support you in your fitness endeavours but can&apos;t find anyone?</p>
      <p className='question'>Ever found yourself feeling lonely or bored during your exercise?</p>
      <p>At Spotter, we found ourselves asking ourselves these very questions, and so we created a space to do something about it.</p>
      <p>Spotter is a place where users can come and search for other like-minded individuals to assist them on their journey to greater fitness</p>
      <p>Whether you are searching for someone to spot you while lifting weights, someone to just chat to in the gym, or even just someone to keep you company on your evening runs, Spotter is the place for you.</p>
      <p>At Spotter we take user security <span className='very'>very</span> seriously. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve set up a number of filters so that users can block searches from others who they might not feel comfortable looking at their profiles, or can remove themselves from all searches entirely.</p>
